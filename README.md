# Machine Learning Algorithms ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, organized into separate directories for easy reference and learning.

## Directories

### 1. Decision Trees
- Implementations of decision tree algorithms, encompassing both classification and regression trees.
- Dive into how decision trees recursively partition feature spaces to make predictions.

### 2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm tailored for both classification and regression tasks.
- Explore how KNN assigns labels or predicts values based on the majority vote or average of nearest neighbors.

### 3. Naive Bayes
- Implementations of Naive Bayes classifiers, a class of probabilistic models based on Bayes' theorem with strong feature independence assumptions.
- Understand how Naive Bayes models perform well in practice despite their simplicity.

### 4. Lasso Regression
- Implementations of Lasso regression, a linear regression technique incorporating L1 regularization to encourage sparsity in coefficient weights.
- Delve into how Lasso regression facilitates feature selection and mitigates overfitting.

### 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Implementations of Support Vector Machine algorithms for both classification and regression objectives.
- Learn about SVM's utility in binary and multiclass classification, as well as regression tasks.
